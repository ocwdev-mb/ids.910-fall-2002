### Assignment 1 (Due Monday, Week 2)

Write a 2-3 page paper (double-spaced) in which you:

*   Identify the specific leadership skills you want to develop further during your time as a TPP student - your "future vision."
*   Explain the rationale for why you have selected these skills.
*   Indicate your assessment of where you are at today with respect to these skills - your "current reality."
*   Spell out an action plan to further develop these skills.
*   Establish clear measurable indicators to track progress during this time.

_Simplified Example:_

Skill: Active Listening.

Rationale: Technology Policy Leaders have to be able to listen well if they are to lead effectively. Too often, the "logic of the technology" or the politics of the situation takes over and the listening doesn't take place.

Assessment: I listen well when I focus on this skill, but most of the time this is not the case. In particular, I don't take enough time to paraphrase back to people what I have heard them say.

Action Plan: Every morning I will identify one critical conversation likely to happen that day and make a personal commitment to listening effectively.

Measurables: I will set up a matrix to track progress -- assessing how I am doing on a daily or weekly basis (whichever works best -- I will start with the daily tracking).

**Note:** Anticipate using this paper as a "baseline" measure, re-examining the paper at various times during the TPP program (especially as a point of reflection towards the end of the program).
